About me
--------

As of September 2015, I'm teaching myself to code and blogging about my experiences.

Prior to this I was Senior Data & Analytics Manager at [busuu](http://busuu.com), a language-learning startup. Before working at busuu, I was a Senior Associate Consultant at [Bain & Company](http://bain.com), a global strategy consulting firm.

Before that, I studied Economics at [Yale University](http://yale.edu) and [Warwick University](http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/).


About this site
---------------

It's built using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), a static blog generator. I started off with the [Poole](http://github.com/poole/poole) placeholder, before adding a few nice things (like comments and tags) and tweaking the layout. You can find more info about Jekyll in [my first blog post]({% post_url 2015-09-05-The-house-that-Jekyll-built %}).

All the code for this site is on [Github](http://github.com/k5han/k5han.com).
